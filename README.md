The first part of this software is designed to be the firmware for the Microchip Technology PIC18F46K22 microcontroller-based TK-X03 computer. It implements emulation support for executing ZiLOG Z80 microprocessor bytecode, and it implements virtual peripherial controllers that will facilitate access to the two onboard LED segment displays and the RS-232 interface controller. It is written in a C language that has been adapted for microcontroller development, and is compiled with the XC8 compiler.

The second part of this software is the operating system, compiled into binary compatible instructions for the Z80 microprocessor from assembly language.

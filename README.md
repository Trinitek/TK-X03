// // //

The first part of this software is designed to be the firmware for the Microchip Technology PIC18F46K22 microcontroller-based TK-X03 computer. It implements emulation support for executing bytecode of a custom processor architecture for a microprocessor called the TK3081, and it implements virtual peripherial controllers that will facilitate access to the two onboard LED segment displays and the RS-232 interface controller. It is written in a C language that has been adapted for microcontroller development, and is compiled with the XC8 compiler.
